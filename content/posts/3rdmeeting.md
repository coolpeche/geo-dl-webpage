# Vladimir presentation

Presentation can be downloaded [**here**](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk/presentations/vladimir01.pdf).

Vladimir presented the results from the first [pointNet paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Qi_PointNet_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). The main application is classificaiton and segmentation of point clouds. The method is made to be invariant to the permutations of the points in the pointcloud, i.e. order of the points should not matter.

# Kristine presentation

Presentation can be downloaded [**here**](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk/presentations/kristine01.pptx).

In this meeting Kristine presented the results from the paper [*Cascade Multi-view Hourglass Model for Robust 3D Face Alignment*](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/documents/fg2018_3dalignment.pdf). This builds on the original [*hourglass paper*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf). The idea is to have two original hourglass networks trained end to end. The first one creates probability maps for the annotations points, and the second refines the predicitons and reduces variation. The explore several different variants compared to a baseline implementation. Interesting combination of 2D and 3D landmarks.

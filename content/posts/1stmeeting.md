# Rasmus 1st presentation

Presentation can be downloaded [**here**](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk/presentations/rapa01.pptx).

In the first session Rasmus presented results and approaches from the papers [*Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Shape Recognition*](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) and [*Volumetric and Multi-View CNNs for Object Classification on 3D Data*](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Qi_Volumetric_and_Multi-View_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). Both papers are about classification of 3D-shape data, the first one creates multiple different renderings, which are passed through the same CNN and *view-pooled*. The second paper takes a model and transforms it into a voxalized representation before feeding it into a CNN.

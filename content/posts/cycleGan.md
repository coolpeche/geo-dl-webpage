# Gudmundur presentation

The presentation can be found [**here**](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk/presentations/gudmundur2/cyclegans.html).

In the presentation I went into the fundamental ideas behind cycle GANs and what they can be used for, most notable image to image translation and image synthesis. There are few notable things about the cycle GAN paper, one of the main is how well all the major ideas are presented. The paper is a joy to read, and if you have not read it already, I highly recommend it.

# IACG Journal club for geometric deep learning

This journal club is organized by Associate Professor [Rasmus R. Paulsen](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~rapa/) and Postdoctoral researcher [Gudmundur Einarsson](https://gumeo.github.io/). Our aim is to strengthen the internal knowledge of the cutting edge research in geometric deep learning. The current aim and format is to have weekly meetings where one of the participants reviews and presents a paper on (or related to) geometric deep learning. The summary of the presentation will be added here as a blog post, we will also keep a pool of papers for future presentations. The current team is:

* Rasmus R. Paulsen
* Gudmundur Einarsson
* ASM Shihavuddin
* Vladimir Fedorov
* Florian Gawrilowicz
* Kristine Aavild Juhl

If you are interested to join the reading club for discussion or presenting, you are welcome to send a mail to Gudmundur (guei@dtu.dk) or Rasmus (rapa@dtu.dk).

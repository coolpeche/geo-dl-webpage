# Geometric Deep Learning Journal Club Webpage

## About

Spring of 2018 we started a geometric deep learning journal club at the image group at DTU. This page was created to document the activities and keep track of the massive amounts of new papers.

You can make a pull request to add new content, everything is in markdown format to keep things simple and portable. Contirbutions can be in terms of suggestions of papers for the paper pool or a blog post reagrding something new and interesting in geometric deep learning.

      <description>Gudmundur presentation I will upload a summary of the presentation, along with the presentation itself after the journal club meeting, which is scheduled for the 3rd of October.
For now, those who are eager to get a headstart on GANs, I recommend reading the original paper by Ian Goodfellow et al. This original paper from 2014 has currently been cited almost 5000 times. I will also try to find some more up to date material, I will progressively update this post with papers and blog posts relevant for the presentation.</description>
